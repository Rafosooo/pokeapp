🎮 PokeApp — API-Driven Pokémon Data Platform

PokeApp is a modern web application built with Vite that provides real-time access to structured Pokémon game data such as base stats, moves, abilities, evolution chains, and type effectiveness.
The application consumes external REST API endpoints and dynamically renders an interactive interface to support in-game decision-making.
